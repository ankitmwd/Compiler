# Day 1: Learning and Execution Summary
TO RUN THIS File
1->cmake --build build/
2->./build/hydro test.hy
3->./out
4->echo $?

cmake --build build/
./build/hydro test.hy
./out
echo $?
## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- GCC or Clang (C++ compiler)
- NASM (Netwide Assembler)
- LD (GNU Linker)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Build Directory
Organize the build files by creating a separate directory:

mkdir build

### 2. Generate Build Files with CMake
Run the following command to generate the necessary build files:

cmake -S . -B build/

### 3. Compile the Project
Build the project using CMake:

cmake --build build/

## Running the Compiler

### 1. Create a Test File
Create a file named test.hy and add the following content:

return 51;

### 2. Run the Compiler
Execute the following command to compile the test file:

./build/hydro test.hy

### 3. Run the Generated Executable
Execute the compiled output:

./out

### 4. Verify the Exit Status
Check the program's exit status:

echo $?

Expected output:

51

## Example Output

When the compiler runs successfully, you should see output similar to the following:

global _start
_start:
   mov rax, 60
   mov rdi, 51
   syscall
Assembly code written to out.asm
NASM command exit status: 0
LD command exit status: 0
